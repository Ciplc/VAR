<h2>
	The mission of VAR CMP
</h2>
<p>
The overall mission of the VAR CMP is to mimic the full scale launch vehicles and operations of the present aerospace industry with what we can realistically and legally do and what we can legally obtain. This includes thrust vectoring, flight avionics, pad infrastructure, test infrastructure, and maybe retropropulsion later in the future.
