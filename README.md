# VAR
The VAR repository.
For those of you new to C++ here are two resources that I found helpful:
http://www.learncpp.com/

For those of you new to Python, talk to me for help in addition to
looking up several tutorials online, most tutorials are perfectly 
fine to learn from. Learning by doing is a great technique.

To commit to master you must verify your commits using GPG keys. Merging requires 1 reviewer.
