	The mission of VAR CMP
</h2>
<p>
The mission of CMP is simple, to create a guided rocket which we can control via trust vectoring. We will design a Trust Vectoring Unit and the software to run it. We will also create a launch pad which will operate via a rail with software integration to stop the launch remotely.
