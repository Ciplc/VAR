There are difficulties installing picamera as of 1/25/19
To install you need:
1. Clone the git repo https://github.com/waveform80/picamera
2. cd into the top level dir
3. run 'pip wheel .'
4. run 'python setup.py bdist_wheel'

At this point you have built the wheel and can then install with the following
'pip install ./dist/wheel_name.whl' where wheel_name is the name of the wheel file that was built
